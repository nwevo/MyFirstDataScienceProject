# MyFirstDataScienceProject
Application of K-Nearest Neighbours Classification Model on “Default of Credit Card Clients” dataset sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
The primary aim of this task is to build the model with the selected dataset and in doing this we will be applying two separate data preparation methods to compare their impact on the overall 
accuracy and precision of the model.
